# smartcrypto (C bindings)

SmartView2 handshake Golang library for Samsung Smart TV H/J (2014/2015) models

This branch contains a C implementation of the handshake based on sectroyer's
[SmartCrypto POC](https://github.com/sectroyer/SmartCrypto/tree/master/SmartCrypto)
and cgo bindings for Golang.

The C code has been somewhat improved and turned into a kind of library.
